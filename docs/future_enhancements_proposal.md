# Future Ops: Enhancement Proposals
**Status**: Pending Approval

Commander, here are 3 proposed vectors for the next phase of Vanguard development.

## 1. Vector: AI Strategist (Intelligence Layer)
**Goal**: Integrate LLM capabilities to act as a true "Vanguard".
- **Mission Briefings**: Generate a "Briefing" for the selected game using AI (Lore summary, key mechanics, tips).
- **Tactical Advisor**: A chat interface in the dashboard to ask "What should I play if I have 30 minutes and like stealth?"
- **Achievement Guide**: auto-fetch guides for the specific missing achievements in your Hunter Protocol.

## 2. Vector: Fleet Organization (Deep Library Management)
**Goal**: Automated structure for large libraries.
- **Auto-Categorization**: Automatically tag and group games by Genre (FPS, RPG, RTS) using Steam Store data.
- **Squads (Collections)**: Create custom named collections (e.g., "Co-op Night", "Backlog", "Completed").
- **Metacritic Intel**: Integrate Metacritic scores into the Game Cards for quality assessment.

## 3. Vector: Global Sync (Cloud Persistence)
**Goal**: Cross-device mission continuity.
- **Cloud Save**: Persist your "Field Notes", "Blacklist", and "Black Ops" settings to a cloud database (Supabase/Firebase).
- **Multi-Device Support**: Access your Vanguard dashboard from your laptop or desktop with synchronized data.

## 4. Vector: Visual Warfare (Theming)
**Goal**: Custom interface personalization.
- **Color Protocols**: Toggle between color schemes:
    - **Default**: Indigo/Cyber (Current)
    - **Red Alert**: Crimson/Black
    - **Night Vision**: Green/Black (Terminal style)
- **Compact Geometry**: A "High Density" mode for the library to show more assets on screen.
